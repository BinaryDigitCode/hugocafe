For this site what I realize is that I absolutely love this theme and the customization of it all. Blowfish is incredible and comes with a lot of built in options! Now that I\u0026rsquo;ve tinkered with both 11ty and Hugo, I\u0026rsquo;m more familiar with file layouts, tinkering with the code, and am able to have a clearer vision of where I want my site to go. I think I\u0026rsquo;ll make another series for photos, projects, games etc, or keep them organized with tags and/or categories. I\u0026rsquo;ll eventually venture into customizing a layout or partial and really make it my own.\nI\u0026rsquo;m able to make this site more image heavy since I love color, creating backgrounds with Canva, posting images and making it fun all around. The theme has image optimization built in so I might as well take advantage of it. This website is not for the low bandwidth and I\u0026rsquo;m ok with that for a personal website. Be warned if on mobile. üòÖ\nI\u0026rsquo;ve started up Giscus comments again along with a \u0026ldquo;send a message\u0026rdquo; dropdown section for a Letterbird contact form. I subscribed for the year to show them support since I love how easy it is to embed and customize the form anywhere on the site, any webpage and it\u0026rsquo;s built in Scribbles.\nI also realize that when I\u0026rsquo;m ready to create for this website, I\u0026rsquo;ll take the time to open up my code editor and create a feature image, markdown, and write a proper post or article. The fast blogging will be kept on my Scribbles notes blog, which is perfect. You can visit there for my daily/weekly blog posts! I\u0026rsquo;m a lifetime member there so have have other Scribbles blogs for other purposes. üíõ\n","date":"May 27 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/always-tinkering/","section":"Posts and Articles","summary":"I\u0026rsquo;m back on Hugo, to the surprise of no one.","title":"Always Tinkering","type":"posts"},{"content":" https://example.com\n","date":"May 27 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/links/test/","section":"Links","summary":"https://example.","title":"Fave links, a test","type":"links"},{"content":"","date":"May 27 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/links/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"links","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"May 27 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/links/","section":"Links","summary":"","title":"Links","type":"links"},{"content":"","date":"May 27 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/","section":"Posts and Articles","summary":"","title":"Posts and Articles","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"May 27 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"May 27 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/tech/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"tech","type":"tags"},{"content":" I\u0026#39;ve never successfully done any of these challenges such as photo a day or blogging a day, but why not give it a try right?

I was able to add a third blog \u0026ldquo;lizexample.micro.blog\u0026rdquo; with another domain, but it would still be part of my @BinaryDigit@micro.blog fediverse account, which makes sense.

One friend in particular, who I\u0026rsquo;ve known for a few years now, got us excited to play and get really into it. Funny enough, I\u0026rsquo;ve owned Counter-Strike for many years (before it became free as CS:GO), but hardly played as I didn\u0026rsquo;t have friends back then to learn with. Now I can\u0026rsquo;t get enough and am happy to learn the maps as I go (right now we all know Dust II pretty well). Lately my buddies all bought skins here and there, starting with a cheap pistol or rifle skin, up to getting new agents (I\u0026rsquo;m up to 3 now) and my long time friend said he ws going to buy a knife. If anyone knows Counter-Strike, non-default knives are pretty rare and it\u0026rsquo;s a flex to own one. The virtual Steam market for CS2 is insane, and we\u0026rsquo;ve all caved at some point with our virtual purchases. My boyfriend even got a cool knife the other day, and it\u0026rsquo;s awesome to see him flip it around and have fun with it.\nAs you\u0026rsquo;ve might have read, I blogged about a huge life goal - paying off my student loans! And so, my friend who was also excited for my news was like \u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip;So what will you do, or buy, to celebrate?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd so I knew exactly what he was asking. Will I finally get a knife, the flexiest of all flexes in the Counter-Strike world.\nAs far as knives go, I\u0026rsquo;m a newbie, first and foremost. I remember seeing someone rock the dual-handed shaddow daggers, even though they are a bit meme-d on being called something else (which I\u0026rsquo;ll let you search for ü§£). I like the color schemes, the small shape, that they are two handed, and of course have a cool animation. I browsed the Steam market in shock of the prices for them. I had a gift card in my wallet already, plus I was willing to spend a little bit of money that I would have spent on a student loan payment, towards this celebratory item. After much back and forth, I ended up absolutely falling in love with a set that of course, ended up being twice more than I wanted to spend.\n\u0026ldquo;Buy nice or buy twice\u0026rdquo; as they say. # If it wasn\u0026rsquo;t this, it would have been an awesome bag, or Jordans, new earrings, or a new console. But, I figure let me have fun in the digital world and rock an item that I would have never bought before and remember this moment in time where I spent adult money on an item that I could flex with just because, and if I wanted to, at least, sell back on the Steam market.\nIntroducing the\u0026hellip;\nShaddow Daggers Doppler Phase 1! # Here\u0026rsquo;s a youtube video if you want to see the animation:\nNow I need to get good ü§ì And no, I won\u0026rsquo;t be your Steam friend unless I know you ü§£\n","date":"Mar 7 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/celebrate/","section":"Posts and Articles","summary":"Gaming with Friends # I play Counter-Strike almost every night with my boyfriend and our buddies in our discord.","title":"Celebrate How You Want To","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"Mar 7 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/fun/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"fun","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"Mar 7 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/gaming/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"gaming","type":"tags"},{"content":" Neocities # I\u0026rsquo;ve always loved the idea of Neocities and have tinkered with my free site there for a few months but never landed on a long term project.

It\u0026rsquo;s awesome and available on the free tier.\nRecently I\u0026rsquo;ve seen more and more people on the supporter plan where you can host unlimited sites, have increased bandwidth, use custom domain names, and support open source and the small web.

Ever since I set up WordPress over again, I haven\u0026rsquo;t been happy with the experience. It\u0026rsquo;s bloated and slow, I only wrote a couple of posts, and I kept fiddling with themes and plugins instead of writing. I\u0026rsquo;m naturally a fiddler with code since I love making and changing aethestics of themes and things. The reason I\u0026rsquo;m looking for simple blogging software is to:\nBlog more, even if they are short random thoughts. I found my old Tumblr and WordPress archives and miss reading about those parts of my life. I don\u0026rsquo;t really want to update Hugo (running on this site) or 11ty for blogging, it\u0026rsquo;s too much work for a short post. I want a decent editor interface, with markdown and abiliity to upload photos and link from my personal gallery or some.pics. I want to be able to enjoy the writing experience with good simple UI I want to be able to change themes and then edit them as I want to - colors, fonts, links. I don\u0026rsquo;t mind spending up to $5-6 a month for a service, as long as I can export it when needed. I want to support the platform and feel that\u0026rsquo;s about what I\u0026rsquo;d pay. I had micro.blog which was great, I love the activitypub integration; but sometimes complicated with theming, also confusing when looking up profiles, and things broke more frequently than I wanted. Down to Three # I whittled it down to Scribbles, Pika, and Bear. All services that are specfically made for micro blogging and on the small web.\nI really loved the idea of Scribbles, other blog discoverability, and Vincent is wonderful and responsive, it just doesn\u0026rsquo;t have enough of the above features that I wanted right now. I will keep afloat on updates to that service for sure!\nI then signed up for Pika and Bear. I absolutely loved the easy UI of Pika. You sit down, pick a theme color, font, and you\u0026rsquo;re ready to go. You are able to adjust CSS as well, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t have much to change.\nWhen I signed up for Bear, immediately I noticed how much I could customize on the free tier. I\u0026rsquo;m able to not only customize how my blog looks to the reader, but how it look to me in the dashboard CSS! I can add a basic styling to buttons (since by default it\u0026rsquo;s quite \u0026hellip;bareü•Å, and change the fonts and size while in the editor. It helps me tremendously. Herman has clear docs and for the pro plan at $5 a month you add a custom domain, image uploading (on the free tier you can only link from another source which is fine but not always ideal), has analytics (not a big deal for me but might be nice to check), run JS scripts, an email subscriber list (which I may or may not use), and ability to add code to the head and footer. You can also see a disovery list of other Bear blogs.\nFor me, the winner will be Bear. Pika is also still new, so I will also be keeping an eye out for updates from the team at Good Enough. I love what they do and currently signed up for Letterbird and Album Whale.\nI look forward to more updates from both Pika and Scribbles! And don\u0026rsquo;t be surprised if I write a new update in 6 months when I change my mind to another service. üòÖ\nIf you have any other small web blog platforms send them my way on Mastodon!

I still enjoy some parts of tech, but really don\u0026rsquo;t like the way many things are going, and don\u0026rsquo;t want to do what I\u0026rsquo;ve done before (mainly in the support space). I\u0026rsquo;m going to focus on fun projects and pay attention to social media like Mastodon, discord, and the better parts of \u0026ldquo;mainstream\u0026rdquo; social media. It would be cool to work in the indie web space, or finally get a creative job. \u0026hellip;somehow :)\n","date":"Jan 13 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/goals2024/","section":"Posts and Articles","summary":"I can\u0026rsquo;t believe it\u0026rsquo;s 2024!","title":"Goals for January","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"Jan 13 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/health/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"health","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"Nov 17 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/cafe/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"cafe","type":"tags"},{"content":" Static Site Generators # For ages I resisted static site generators. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t wrap my head around the complexity of them, or why I would need one. But then, I got to know the indie web, aka, the small web. The movement of people going back to focus on their own websites, owning a domain name, and publishing content on your website then out to other services, aka POSSE - Publish (on your) Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere. I always wanted to keep that motto all these years, but kept jumping around from a social blog to another social blog, to Wordpress, and back. Now I\u0026rsquo;ve landed on micro.blog, but even want to avoid using that in the future if I can help it. It helps save a few bucks a month as well as learn the intricacies of static site generators.\nTinkering # Since micro.blog is built with Hugo, I went back to trying to learn it. I first edited my micro.blog theme with the custom editor, and then decided to give Hugo a try on my own. Lo and behold, it finally \u0026ldquo;clicked\u0026rdquo;. I tried a couple of themes, and then landed upton this one, named Blowfish. It\u0026rsquo;s so awesome! It\u0026rsquo;s incredibly customizable and helped me learn so many details about Hugo. I then was able to push my git repo to Netlify and have it hosted there for free! I\u0026rsquo;m super happy that I\u0026rsquo;m able to finally have a digital garden (cafe) and blog on my own domain, not worried about a major service going down, an acquisition, or paying a ton of money for hosting each month. I hope I can keep it running for a while and never go back to hosting again (unless they offer something that I couldn\u0026rsquo;t resist). Next up, I\u0026rsquo;ll try to import old posts.\nThanks for reading!\n","date":"Nov 17 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/hugo-setup/","section":"Posts and Articles","summary":"Static Site Generators # For ages I resisted static site generators.","title":"My Website Setup","type":"posts"},{"content":"Welcome to my attempt at a new site with Hugo, finally, on my own domain and hosted via netlify/github!
