I've decided to remove webmentions from this website, in favor of trying out [Giscus](https://giscus.app/), a commenting system powered by GitHub discussions. Since most of the people I've run into on the nerdiverse(fediverse) who might read this website probably use Github, why not try to use a free comment system based on it. It also includes reactions which are cool to see for feedback.

I've removed tinylitics since I tend not to ever glance at the data, just the kudos (which would be replaced by the Giscus reactions).

I'll see how I like it for a while since it's free and looks pretty cool! 

Next step would be for me to add a "reply on Mastodon" button, in case folks don't have a GitHub profile to comment and want to.
