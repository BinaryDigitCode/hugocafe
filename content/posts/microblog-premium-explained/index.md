After reading the help article on micro blog, I still really didn't grasp how multiple blogs on Micro.blog Premium worked, so I took a chance and bought it for a month to give it a try.

I have one Micro.blog account (https://micro.blog/account) with 2 blogs created; one here at blog.binarydigit.cafe (actually binarydigit.micro.blog), and one at binarydigit.stream (actually bstreams.micro.blog). Both are domains attached to each actual "micro blog". You can see them in the dropdown menus in the "Account" tab within the dashboard.

I wanted to use another fediverse account on micro.blog, so I was curious if I could make a second, called "@Liz@micro.blog" or similar. I was able to add a third blog "lizexample.micro.blog" with another domain, but it would still be part of my @BinaryDigit@micro.blog fediverse account, which makes sense. So it wouldn't work if I wanted two different fediverse micro.blog accounts. You can only have one.

So think of it all as:

- 1 main Micro.blog "account" which is your fediverse handle here [@Username@micro.blog](https://micro.blog/Username)
- Up to 5 different "sub blogs" which would still go to that [@Username@micro.blog](https://micro.blog/Username) timeline. You can still cross post individually on the sub blog level RSS feed seen here:

- but the main difference is the attachment to the main fediverse account.

I hope this helps clear up any confusing that other folks might be having!
